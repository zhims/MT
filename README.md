Measure Theory

These lectures are mainly based on the books Introduction to measure and integration by S. Taylor published by Cambridge University Press.

These notes were live-TeXed, though I edited for typos and added diagrams requiring the Ti\textit{k}Z package separately. I used the editor TeXstudio.

I am responsible for all faults in this document, mathematical or otherwise; any merits of the material here should be credited to the lecturer, not to me.

Thank you to all of my friends  who will send me suggestions and corrections. My notes will be  much improved due to your help.

I would like to especially thank the IMPA and Professor Landim  who put their courses in website.
